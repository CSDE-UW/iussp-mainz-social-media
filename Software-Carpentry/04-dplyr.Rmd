# Data Manipulation using dplyr

Bracket subsetting is handy, but it can be cumbersome and difficult to read,
especially for complicated operations. Enter `dplyr`. `dplyr` is a package for
making data manipulation easier.

Packages in R are basically sets of additional functions that let you do more
stuff. The functions we've been using so far, like `str()` or `data.frame()`,
come built into R; packages give you access to more of them. Before you use a
package for the first time you need to install it on your machine, and then you
should to import it in every subsequent R session when you'll need it.

```{r, eval = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
install.packages("dplyr")
```

You might get asked to choose a CRAN mirror -- this is basically asking you to
choose a site to download the package from. The choice doesn't matter too much;
we recommend the RStudio mirror.

```{r, message = FALSE, purl = FALSE}
library("dplyr")    ## load the package
```

## What is `dplyr`?

The package `dplyr` provides easy tools for the most common data manipulation
tasks. It is built to work directly with data frames. The thinking behind it was
largely inspired by the package `plyr` which has been in use for some time but
suffered from being slow in some cases.` dplyr` addresses this by porting much
of the computation to C++. An additional feature is the ability to work with
data stored directly in an external database. The benefits of doing this are
that the data can be managed natively in a relational database, queries can be
conducted on that database, and only the results of the query returned.

This addresses a common problem with R in that all operations are conducted in
memory and thus the amount of data you can work with is limited by available
memory. The database connections essentially remove that limitation in that you
can have a database of many 100s GB, conduct queries on it directly, and pull
back just what you need for analysis in R.

[handy dplyr cheatsheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).


## Selecting columns and filtering rows

We're going to learn some of the most common `dplyr` functions: `select()`,
`filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`. To select columns of a
data frame, use `select()`. The first argument to this function is the data
frame (`surveys`), and the subsequent arguments are the columns to keep.

```{r, results = 'hide', purl = FALSE}
select(surveys, plot_id, species_id, weight)
```

To choose rows, use `filter()`:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
filter(surveys, year == 1995)
```

## Pipes

But what if you wanted to select and filter at the same time? There are three
ways to do this: use intermediate steps, nested functions, or pipes. With the
intermediate steps, you essentially create a temporary data frame and use that
as input to the next function. This can clutter up your workspace with lots of
objects. You can also nest functions (i.e. one function inside of another).
This is handy, but can be difficult to read if too many functions are nested as
the process from inside out. The last option, pipes, are a fairly recent
addition to R. Pipes let you take the output of one function and send it
directly to the next, which is useful when you need to many things to the same
data set.  Pipes in R look like `%>%` and are made available via the `magrittr`
package installed as part of `dplyr`.

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)
```

In the above we use the pipe to send the `surveys` data set first through
`filter`, to keep rows where `wgt` was less than 5, and then through `select` to
keep the `species` and `sex` columns. When the data frame is being passed to the
`filter()` and `select()` functions through a pipe, we don't need to include it
as an argument to these functions anymore.

If we wanted to create a new object with this smaller version of the data we
could do so by assigning it a new name:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys_sml <- surveys %>%
  filter(weight < 5) %>%
  select(species_id, sex, weight)

surveys_sml
```

Note that the final data frame is the leftmost part of this expression.

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
## Answer
surveys %>%
    filter(year < 1995) %>%
    select(year, sex, weight)
```

### Mutate

Frequently you'll want to create new columns based on the values in existing
columns, for example to do unit conversions, or find the ratio of values in two
columns. For this we'll use `mutate()`.

To create a new column of weight in kg:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000)
```

If this runs off your screen and you just want to see the first few rows, you
can use a pipe to view the `head()` of the data (pipes work with non-dplyr
functions too, as long as the `dplyr` or `magrittr` packages are loaded).

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head
```

The first few rows are full of NAs, so if we wanted to remove those we could
insert a `filter()` in this chain:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  mutate(weight_kg = weight / 1000) %>%
  head
```

`is.na()` is a function that determines whether something is or is not an `NA`.
The `!` symbol negates it, so we're asking for everything that is not an `NA`.

    select(species_id, hindfoot_half)
```

### Split-apply-combine data analysis and the summarize() function

Many data analysis tasks can be approached using the "split-apply-combine"
paradigm: split the data into groups, apply some analysis to each group, and
then combine the results. `dplyr` makes this very easy through the use of the
`group_by()` function.


#### The `summarize()` function

`group_by()` is often used together with `summarize()` which collapses each
group into a single-row summary of that group.  `group_by()` takes as argument
the column names that contain the **categorical** variables for which you want
to calculate the summary statistics. So to view mean the `weight` by sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

You can group by multiple columns too:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE))
```

When grouping both by "sex" and "species_id", the first rows are for individuals
that escaped before their sex could be determined and weighted. You may notice
that the last column does not contain `NA` but `NaN` (which refers to "Not a
Number"). To avoid this, we can remove the missing values for weight before we
attempt to calculate the summary statistics on weight. Because the missing
values are removed, we can omit `na.rm=TRUE` when computing the mean:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight))
```

You may also have noticed, that the output from these calls don't run off the
screen anymore. That's because `dplyr` has changed our `data.frame` to a
`tbl_df`. This is a data structure that's very similar to a data frame; for our
purposes the only difference is that it won't automatically show tons of data
going off the screen, while displaying the data type for each column under its
name. If you want to display more data on the screen, you can add the `print()
function at the end of the with the argument `n` specifying the number of rows
to display:


```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight)) %>%
  print(n=15)
```

Once the data is grouped, you can also summarize multiple variables at the same
time (and not necessarily on the same variable). For instance, we could add a
column indicating the minimum weight for each species for each sex:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>%
  group_by(sex, species_id) %>%
  summarize(mean_weight = mean(weight),
            min_weight = min(weight))
```



#### Tallying

When working with data, it is also common to want to know the number of
observations found for each factor or combination of factors. For this, `dplyr`
provides `tally()`. For example, if we wanted to group by sex and find the
number of rows of data for each sex, we would do:

```{r, purl = FALSE}
surveys %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  tally()
```

Here, `tally()` is the action applied to the groups created to `group_by()` and
counts the total number of records for each category.

# Exporting data

Now that you have learned how to use `dplyr` to extract the information you need
from the raw data, or to summarize your raw data, you may want to export these
new datasets to share them with your collaborators or for archival.

Similarly to the `read.csv()` function used to read in CSV into R, there is a
`write.csv()` function that generates CSV files from data frames.

Before using it, we are going to create a new folder, `data_output` in our
working directory that will store this generated dataset. We don't want to write
generated datasets in the same directory as our raw data. It's good practice to
keep them separate. The `data` folder should only contain the raw, unaltered
data, and should be left alone to make sure we don't delete or modify it; on the
other end the content of `data_output` directory will be generated by our
script, and we know that we can delete the files it contains because we have the
script that can re-generate these files.

In preparation for our next lesson on plotting, we are going to prepare a
cleaned up version of the dataset that doesn't include any missing data.

Let's start by removing observations for which the `species_id` is missing. In
this dataset, the missing species are represented by an empty string and not an
`NA`. Let's also remove observations for which `weight` and the
`hindfoot_length` are missing. This dataset will also only contain observations
of animals for which the sex has been determined:


```{r, purl=FALSE}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>%
  filter(species_id != "",         # remove missing species_id
         !is.na(weight),           # remove missing weight
		 !is.na(hindfoot_length),  # remove missing hindfoot_length
		 sex != "")                # remove missing sex
```

Because we are interested in plotting how species abundances have changed
through time, we are also going to remove observations for rare species (i.e.,
that have been observed less than 50 times). We will do this in two steps: first
we are going to create a dataset that counts how often each species has been
observed, and filter out the rare species; then, we will extract only the
observations for these more common species:

```{r, purl=FALSE}
## Extract the most common species_id
species_counts <- surveys_complete %>%
                  group_by(species_id) %>%
                  tally %>%
				  filter(n >= 50) %>%
				  select(species_id)

## Only keep the most common species
surveys_complete <- surveys_complete %>%
                 filter(species_id %in% species_counts$species_id)
```

To make sure that everyone has the same dataset, check that
`surveys_complete` has `r nrow(surveys_complete)` rows and `r ncol(surveys_complete)`
columns by typing `dim(surveys_complete)`.

Now that our dataset is ready, we can save it as a CSV file in our `data_output`
folder. By default, `write.csv()` includes a column with row names (in our case
the names are just the row numbers), so we need to add `row.names = FALSE` so
they are not included:

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(surveys_complete, file="data_output/surveys_complete.csv",
          row.names=FALSE)
```

```{r, purl=FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
if (!file.exists("data_output")) dir.create("data_output")
write.csv(surveys_complete, file = "data_output/surveys_complete.csv")
```
